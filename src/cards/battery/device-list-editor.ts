/**
 * The battery card's device list, as one control.
 *
 * A device is four things (which sensor, which icon, which charging sensor, what to call it),
 * and this draws each of them as one row of a sortable list: an `ha-expansion-panel`
 * carrying the four fields, with a drag handle beside it and a delete button in its summary.
 * A picker at the bottom adds the next one.
 *
 * ## Why an element of its own rather than `ha-form` rows
 *
 * `ha-form` can nest: a named `expandable` node draws a panel and its rows read an object
 * of their own (`docs/ha-api-notes.md` has the mechanism), and the card was built that way
 * first, with a multiple entity picker above the panels for adding and reordering. It worked
 * and it read as two controls for one list: the device's identity in the picker, the rest of
 * it in a panel further down, and a delete that meant unticking a checkbox somewhere else.
 * Nothing in `ha-form` can hang a handle or a bin off a panel, so the panels could never be
 * the list itself.
 *
 * Home Assistant hand-rolls this same element for its entities card
 * (`hui-entities-card-row-editor`), and everything below is borrowed from it: `ha-sortable`
 * around a wrapper the rows sit in, an `item-moved` event carrying two indices, an empty
 * picker as the add control (behind a button, as theirs is once the list is not empty), and
 * clearing a row's entity as the way to say delete. Its own rows open a dialog to be edited;
 * ours expand in place, which is the one departure and the reason this exists.
 *
 * ## What it may render
 *
 * Only elements Home Assistant has already defined by the time an editor is open:
 * `ha-sortable`, `ha-expansion-panel`, `ha-icon-button`, `ha-svg-icon`, `ha-icon` and
 * `ha-form` all ride in the `lovelace` panel's own chunk group, checked with the script in
 * `docs/ha-api-notes.md`. `ha-entity-picker` and `ha-icon-picker` do **not**: a bare
 * `<ha-entity-picker>` is an undefined element until something has caused its chunk to load,
 * and an undefined element renders as nothing at all, which looks like a bug in this file.
 *
 * Inside a device's panel that is somebody else's problem: those pickers are `ha-form` rows,
 * and `ha-selector` does the lazy import it exists to do. The **add** control is the one place
 * it matters, because what it wants is the picker's own `addButton` mode: a button that opens
 * the list on one press, which is a property of `ha-entity-picker` and cannot be reached
 * through a selector. So `_pickerReady` below waits for the definition rather than assuming
 * it, and until then the add control is the same picker as a plain field, through `ha-form`,
 * which is also the thing that causes the definition to arrive.
