/**
 * `scale` — how big the widget is drawn, as a percentage of the size it was designed at.
 *
 * The first option in this library that is about the room the card is in rather than
 * about its data, and the reason it exists: a widget on a phone is held at arm's length,
 * the same widget on a tablet screwed to a hallway wall is read from across the room, and
 * a dashboard nobody works in wants larger type than one somebody does. Home Assistant's
 * Layout tab settles how much space a card gets and nothing else — a card dragged twice
 * as wide still draws 17px type, only more of it — so how large to draw that type is a
 * question the card has to answer for itself. 100% is the answer it used to give
 * everybody.
 *
 * ## What moves
 *
 * One factor, everything at once: type, spacing, insets, the radius of a row's chip. The
 * card at 120% is the card at 100% seen from closer up, and that is the point — a widget
 * whose type grew while its padding stood still is a different, worse layout rather than
 * the same one bigger. Two things deliberately do not move, and both belong to Home
 * Assistant rather than to us: `ha-card`'s corner radius, which has to agree with the
 * cards sitting next to it on the dashboard, and its 1px border.
 *
 * ## The two halves have to agree
 *
 * Scaling is drawn in CSS — `--cw-scale`, which `tokens.ts` multiplies its lengths by —
 * and *budgeted* in arithmetic: `layout.ts` prices a row of content in pixels, so it has
 * to be told the same number, and it works in design units by dividing the measured box
 * by the factor rather than by multiplying every constant it holds. Those two are one
 * mechanism in two languages. Move one without the other and the card either budgets rows
 * it cannot draw or leaves a strip of the box blank.
 *
 * Which is also why `--cw-scale` is not a theme hook. A stylesheet that set it would
 * change what is drawn without changing what was budgeted, and the card would clip its
 * last row with no way of knowing.

 * The floor, and it is a real one rather than a round number.
 *
 * Smaller type means more content fits the same box, which includes fitting *two columns*
 * of it: `layoutFromBox` compares the design width of the card against
 * `LAYOUT_THRESHOLD`, so shrinking the type walks a card towards the wide layout. The 6×4
 * square — the footprint the small layout was designed for and the one the README shows —
 * is ~246px in a typical section, and 246 / 0.73 crosses that threshold. So below roughly
 * 73% the square quietly becomes two narrow columns, which is a different widget. 80%
 * keeps clear of it.

 * The ceiling, from the same rule read the other way.
 *
 * A full-width card is ~500px, and 500 / 1.47 is where *it* would fold to a single
 * column — so the arithmetic permits rather more than this. The limit here is the design
 * instead: past about 130% the date numeral dominates a default-height card and the row
 * budget it leaves is two or three, which is a poster rather than a widget. Anyone who
 * wants that can have it by dragging the card taller as well.

 * a quoted value parses to — is read as the number it plainly is, and a value outside the
 * range is clamped rather than refused. Clamped and not rejected because the arithmetic
 * itself is happy at any factor: the bounds above are about which of them the widget
 * still looks like itself at, and a config asking for 400% is better answered with a
 * card that is legibly too big than with an error where a dashboard used to be.
